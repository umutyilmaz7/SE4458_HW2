### Technology Stack
- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering
- **React Scripts**: Used for development and build tooling
- **Modern JavaScript**: Utilizes ES6+ features for better code organization and maintainability


## Assumptions
1. The application is designed to run in modern browsers (as specified in browserslist configuration)
2. Node.js and npm are available in the development environment
3. The application is intended for desktop and mobile use
4. React 19.1.0 is used as the core framework

 **Database Integration**: One of the most time-consuming aspects of the project was deciding on and implementing the database solution. The process involved:
